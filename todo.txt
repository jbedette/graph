low - med = high +
++read in data
  +get total size of arr first
  +create arr of vertexes
  

edge isn't picking up nod5->adj as null;
not sure why

set edges is fucked because I defined struct Vertex as nothing 

then when I set everything to that it's always looking int the same place

what if i nest edge within vertex
